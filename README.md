# B2B-invoice-management-system
The Objective of this project is to help businesses to keep track of payment dates in an organized and efficient manner. The project integrates all the invoice details in a single web application making it efficient to view the details of pending invoices.
There are 3 aspects to this project namely: Machine Learning, Front-end/UI development, Back-end development.

## Machine Learning
The Objective of Machine Learning part is to predict the date on which the customer will clear his invoice dues. The dataset includes details of previous transactions done by the customer. 
We use Regression Models to predict the clear date and finally store the new dataset with predicted clear dates in a seperate cvs file.
